# Dots-Boxes-Reinforcement
Developing an intelligent agent to play a game of [dots and boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) optimally using [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).

Additionally making use of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) to write the neural network code. Training for various network structures, learning rates activation functions, etc. and then exploring each model's predictions.

The entire project is documented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org).
