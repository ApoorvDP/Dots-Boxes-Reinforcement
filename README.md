# Dots-Boxes-Reinforcement
A program where both players use [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) to play [dots and boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) in an optimal manner.

This entire project is formatted as a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org), which contains all of the explanation, code/methods and results. The notebook can be downloaded, modified and run again if so desired.

However, please note that the notebook requires additional code to run, which was provided by [professor Chuck Anderson](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/wp/). The additional code has NOT been uploaded to this repository.  
Kindly contact professor Anderson, requesting the neural network code, and then run the jupyter notebook.

To reiterate: **If you wish to run the jupyter notebook, do so _only after_ obtaining the additional code, otherwise running the notebook WILL NOT WORK.**
